Part 1 Chapter 6: COMPILE-TIME POLYMORPHISM
-------------------------------------------

    Compile-time polymorphism with templates.
    Declare and use templates.
    Enforce type safety.
    Survey some of the templates more advanced usages.
    Comparison of runtime and compile-time polymorphism in C++.


Templates
---------

    Compile-time polymorphism is achieved in C++ through templates.
    
    What is a template?
        - Class or function with template parameters.
        - Params can stand in for any type.
        - Compiler will stamp out a bespoke template instantiation when a template is used with a type.
