Part 1 Chapter 5: RUNTIME POLYMORPHISM
--------------------------------------

    Polymorphism

    Code that can be reused with different types.
    Loosely coupled, highly reusable.
    Makes code more maintainable and readable.


    Two polymorphic approaches:

    Compile-time polymorphic code.
        Incorporates polymorphic types you can determine at compile time.

    Runtime polymorphism.
        Incorporates types determined at runtime.
