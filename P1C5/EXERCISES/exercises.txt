Part 1, Chapter 5 EXERCISES
---------------------------

5-1.    You didn't implement an accounting system in your Bank. Design an interface called AccountDatabase that can retrieve and set amounts in bank accounts (identified by a long id).

5-2.    Genereate an InMemoryAccountDatabase that implements AccountDatabase.

5-3.    Add an AccountDatabase reference member to Bank. Use constructor injection to add an InMemoryAccountDatabase to the Bank.

5-4.    Modify ConsoleLogger to accept a const char* at construction. When ConsoleLogger logs, prepend this string to the logging output. Notice that you can modify logging behaviour without having to modify Bank.
