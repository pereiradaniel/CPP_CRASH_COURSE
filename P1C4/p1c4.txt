# INHERITANCE

Understanding that sub-classes can inherit the functionality of their super-classes, is essential before learning about the stdlib exceptions.

EXAMPLE:

```
struct Superclass {
    int x;
};

struct Subclass : Superclass {
    // Inherits members from Superclass that are not marked private!
    int y;
    int foo() {
        return x + y; // Subclass inherits int x from Superclass!
    }
};

```

Handlers will catch a given type and any of its childrens' types.


# stdlib Exception Classes

Inheritance has crucial impact on how code handles exceptions.
stdlib contais useful exception types readily available to be used.


# Standard Exception Classes

<stdexcept> header

std::exception is the superclass for all the sandard exception classes.

Three main groups of subclasses in std::exception:

    1. logic errors     <- Will encounter!
    2. runtime errors   <- Will encounter!
    3. language support errors (not that relevant)

---------------------------- 
exception:
    runtime_error:
        system-error,
        underflow_error,
        overflow_error,
        ...
    logic_error:
        domain_error,
        invalid-argument,
        length_error,
        out_of_range,
        ...
bad_cast,
bad_alloc,
...
---------------------------- 

# Logic errors

Derive from the logic_error class.
Can be avoided through careful programming.

Subclasses to be aware of:

    domain_error
    Errors related to valid input range.

    invalid_argument
    Unexpected arguments.

    length_error
    Some action violates the maximum size constraint.

    out_of_range
    Some value is not within expected range.


# Runtime Errors

Derive from the runtime_error class.
Help to report error conditions outside the program's scope.

Subclasses to be aware of:

    system_error
    Operating system has encountered some error.

    over_flow and under_flow
    Arithmetic overflow and underflow.


# Other Errors

Inherit directly from exception.

    bad_alloc
    Keyword new failed to allocate required memory for dynamic storage.


# Language Support Errors

Indicate that some core language feature failed at runtime.
Programmers do not use these errors directly.


# Handling exceptions

Rules for handling exceptioons are based on class inheritance.
A catch block can handle a thrown exception if the type matches the handler's exception type, or if the thrown type *inherits* from the handler's type.

Handling different types of exceptions originating from the same try block:

```
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception.
} catch (const std::logic_error& ex) {
    // Log exception and terminate the program: Programming error.
} catch (const std::runtime_error& ex) {
    // Try to recover.
} catch (const std::exception& ex) {
    // Handle any exception deriving from std:exception that is not a logic_error or runtime_error.
} catch(...) {
    // Unforseen exception type has been thrown.
}

```


# RETHROWING AN Exception

Within a catch block the throw keyword can be used: This is called rethrowing an exception.

```
try {
        // Code that might throw a system_error.

} catch(const std::system_error& ex) {
    if (ex.code()! = std::errc::permission_denied) {
        // Not a permission denied error!
        throw;  // Rethrow if not an EACCES error.
    }
    // Recover from permission denied.
}

```

There are performance penalties to using this convoluted code! Define a new exception type and create a separate catch handler for the EACCES error:


```
try {
        // Throw a PermissionDenied instead
} catch(const PermissionDenied& ex) {
    // Recover from an EACCES error (Permission Denied) ...
}

```


# User-Defined Exceptions

Inherit from std::exception.


# The noexcept Keyword

Any function that cannot possibly throw an exception should be marked as noexcept.

```
bool is_odd(int x) noexcept {
    return 1 == (x % 2);
}

```

Program will crash if your code throws an exception inside a function marked noexcept.
Functions marked noexcept will enable some code optimizations. The compiler can use move semantics.


# Call Stacks and Exceptions

The 'call stack' is a runtime structure that stores information about active functions.


# Stacks

A stack is a flexible data container that canhold a dynamic nnumber of elements.

Two essential operations that stacks support:

    1. pushing elements onto the top of the stack
    2. popping elements off the top of the stack

Stacks are a last-in, first-out data structure.


# Call Stacks and Exception Handling

Runtime seeks the closest exception handler to the thrown exception. If no matching handler exists in the current stack frame, the runtime will unwind the call stacl until a suitable handler is found. Objects whose lifetimes are ended get destroyed in the usual way.


# Throwing in Destructors

Exceptions throwin in a destructor must be caught within the destructor.


# SimpleString Class

The example shows how constructors, destructors, members, exceptions work together.

simplestring.cpp adds C-style strings together and then print the result.

A class enclosing a SimpleString as a member must have the string fully constructed and class invariants established before it can complete.

Destructors work the opposite way.


# Alternatives to Exceptions

1. Manually enforce class invariants by exposing some method that communicates whether the class invarants could be established:

struct HumptyDumpty {
    HumptyDumpty();
    bool is_together_again();
};

Check and treat the situation as an error condition in the calling code:

bool send_kings_horses_and_men() {
    HumptyDumpty hd{};
    if(hd.is_together_again()) return false;
    // Class invariants of hd are not guaranteed.
    // Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
    return true;
}

2. Return multiple values using *structured binding declaration*:

struct Result {
    HumptyDumpty hd;
    bool success;
};

Result make_humpty() {
    HumptyDumpty hd{};
    bool is_valid;
    // Check that hd is valid and set is_valid appropriately:
    return {hd, is_valid};
}

bool send_kings_horses_and_men() {
    auto [hd, success] = make_humpty();
    if(!success) return false;
    // Class invariants established
    return true;
}

Explanation:
First you declare a POD that contains a HumptyDumpty and a success flag.
Define the function make_humpty, which builds and validates a HumptyDumpty. This is called a *factory method* because it's purpose is to initialize an object.
make_humpty packs this and the success flag into a Result when it returns.
