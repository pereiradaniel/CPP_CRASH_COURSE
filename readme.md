# README

This repo contains notes and code samples that were made during the reading of *C++ Crash Course*. Some of the code examples are taken from the book, some are inspired by the book, and some are completely my own making. Do not assume that every code sample you read here is from the book. This is just a workspace where I can organize my notes and experiments.

This repo does not necessarily reflect the content found in the book, though it may give you an idea if you'd like to buy it.

The file [./zip/ccc-master.zip](./zip/ccc-master.zip) is freely available from the book's publisher that contains all of the code from the book. Please use this repo for your personal benefit.
